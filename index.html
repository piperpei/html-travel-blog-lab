            Visiting Fire Island in New York was an unforgettable experience. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Fire Island offers countless historic sites to go and explore. Being able to see the lighthouses up close was a 
            breathtaking experience that I recommend everyone has the chance to see in their lifetime. Many other historic 
            structures were surrounded by the beauty of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only were there historical structures but a vast amount of plants and animals to see. The beaches were wonderful
            and the trails offered a peaceful escape in nature.
